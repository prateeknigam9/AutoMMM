The original problem didn't ask for code implementation, but rather a discussion on how to address data quality issues based on the provided report. However, I can provide some general guidance on implementing the steps mentioned earlier.

Here's an updated version of the response that provides more information and context:

### Addressing Data Quality Issues

The report highlights several data quality issues that need attention. Here are some key takeaways and recommendations for addressing these issues:

*   **Missing Values**: Missing values in certain columns can lead to biased models or reduced performance. Consider using techniques like mean/median/mode for `revenue` and `log_price`.
*   **Price Inconsistencies**: Price inconsistencies may result in inaccurate predictions or model bias. Investigate the cause of price inconsistencies and correct them.
*   **Outliers**: Outliers can significantly affect model accuracy, especially if they are influential. Use outlier detection methods to identify influential outliers and handle them using techniques like winsorization, clipping, or transformation.
*   **Long Duration**: Long duration may require handling to avoid seasonal effects or capture long-term trends. Consider splitting data by duration into training and testing sets.
*   **Media Spend Nulls**: Media spend nulls may indicate issues with data collection or processing. Investigate the root causes of media spend nulls and correct them.

### Recommended Actions

1.  Impute missing values using techniques like mean/median/mode for `revenue` and `log_price`.
2.  Address price inconsistencies by investigating the cause and correcting them.
3.  Handle outliers using outlier detection methods to understand their impact on models.
4.  Split data by duration into training and testing sets, considering the long duration.
5.  Investigate media spend nulls to identify root causes.

### Example Use Cases

*   Using this report, you can improve data quality by addressing missing values, price inconsistencies, outliers, and media spend nulls.
*   By implementing robust data management practices, organizations can enhance their models' performance and decision-making capabilities.
*   This report serves as a starting point for further analysis and exploration of the dataset.

Please note that this is not a code implementation, but rather a discussion on how to address data quality issues. If you need help with code implementation or have specific questions, feel free to ask!
