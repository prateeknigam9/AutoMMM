## State Management

The CEO agent maintains a comprehensive state (`CEOState`) that tracks:

```python
class CEOState(TypedDict):
    messages: List[AnyMessage]                    # Communication history
    data_team_status: bool                       # Data team completion status
    modelling_team_status: bool                  # Modelling team completion status
    contribution_team_status: bool               # Contribution team completion status
    overall_project_status: str                  # Overall project status
    current_phase: str                           # Current workflow phase
    next_phase: str                              # Next planned phase
    data_team_report: dict                       # Data team deliverables
    modelling_team_report: dict                  # Modelling team deliverables
    contribution_team_report: dict               # Contribution team deliverables
    final_executive_summary: str                 # Executive summary
    task: str                                    # Current task description
    next_team: str                               # Next team to execute
    command: Literal['chat','run','start','overview','status',None]
```

## Usage

### 1. **Basic Initialization**
```python
from agents.CEO.CEOAgent import CEOAgent

ceo = CEOAgent(
    agent_name="AutoMMM CEO",
    agent_description="Chief Executive Officer overseeing complete AutoMMM workflow",
    backstory="Visionary leader orchestrating data preparation, model execution, and business insights"
)
```

### 2. **Auto-Start Complete Workflow**
```python
# Execute the complete workflow automatically
result = ceo.auto_start_workflow()
```

### 3. **Interactive Chat Mode**
```python
# Initialize state and start interactive session
state = {
    'messages': [{"role": "user", "content": "Start the AutoMMM project"}],
    'data_team_status': False,
    'modelling_team_status': False,
    'contribution_team_status': False,
    # ... other state fields
}

result = ceo.graph.invoke(state)
```

### 4. **Team-Specific Execution**
```python
# Execute specific team workflows
ceo.data_team_node(state)           # Data team workflow
ceo.modelling_team_node(state)      # Modelling team workflow
ceo.contribution_team_node(state)   # Contribution team workflow
```

## Command Interface

The CEO agent responds to JSON commands for team execution:

```json
{
  "call_team": "data_team" | "modelling_team" | "contribution_team" | "overview" | "executive_summary" | "__end__",
  "task": "brief task description for the team"
}
```

### Available Commands:
- **`data_team`**: Execute data handling workflow
- **`modelling_team`**: Execute model execution workflow
- **`contribution_team`**: Execute contribution analysis workflow
- **`overview`**: Generate project overview
- **`executive_summary`**: Create executive summary
- **`__end__`**: End workflow session

## Integration with Main System

The CEO agent is now the primary entry point in `main.py`:

```python
# main.py - CEO is the main entry point
agent = CEOAgent(
    agent_name="AutoMMM CEO",
    agent_description="You are the Chief Executive Officer of AutoMMM...",
    backstory="You are the visionary leader of AutoMMM..."
)

# CEO manages the complete workflow
result = agent.graph.invoke(state, config)
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify CEO agent functionality:

```bash
python test_ceo_agent.py
```

This will test:
- Agent initialization
- Team manager integration
- Workflow graph construction
- Individual team execution
- Chat functionality
