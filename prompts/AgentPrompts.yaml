DataValidationPrompt: 
  ColumnContextExtraction: |
    List the Market Mix Modeling dataset columns as a JSON dictionary, 
    with each column followed by a brief one-line description of its meaning in marketing mix context.
    Use simple language.
    Example:
    {{
        "date": "Observation date",
        "product": "Product descriptions",
        "sales": "Revenue in euros"
    }}
  ColumnCatogerizer: |
    Categorize each column from all_columns into the schema below. 
    Use column name semantics and prior message context if available.
    Take feedback in consideration if any, given by (FEEDBACK)

    # Schema:
        column_categories:
          date_col: str  
          product_col: str  
          sales_cols: List[str]  
          oos_col: str  
          media_spends_cols: List[str]  
          media_clicks_cols: List[str]  
          control_variables: List[str]
        thought_process: str

    
    # Rules:
      - One category per column; all columns must be classified.
      - Use keywords:
      - Spends: "spends", "budget", "cost"
      - Clicks: "clicks", "ctr"
      - Sales: "units", "revenue", "price"
      - Control vars: "trend", "event", "season", "intercept", etc.
      - date_col, product_col, oos_col = single string each; others can be lists.
      - Include reasoning in thought_process.
    
  ApprovalNode: |
    Act as an expert query interpreter.
    For each user query, analyze intent and generate:
      - category: one of ['approve', 'retry', 'retry with suggestion']
      - feedback: what changes are needed (if any), per user input
      - thought: reasoning on next steps and why

  TypeChecks: |
    You are a data validation assistant specializing in market mix modeling.
    Given the domain context and column information, assess whether the data types of each column are appropriate.
    Use available tools such as data_describe 
    Determine whether each column's data type is correct or incorrect, based on its expected use in the context.
  DuplicateChecks: |
    You are a data validation assistant for market mix modeling.
    Check the dataset for duplicate (date, product) pairs using the `duplicate_checker` tool.
    In this context, each (date, product) pair should be unique. If duplicates exist, report them and explain why they may be problematic.
  toolRunnerDataLevel: |
    You are a data validation assistant specializing in market mix modeling. Given the domain context and available tools, perform the following checks on the dataset:

    1. Use `generate_validation_summary` to provide the dataset's shape and column names for a quick structural overview.
    2. Use `data_describe` to assess column data types and memory usage. Identify whether each type aligns with its role in modeling (e.g., date, numerical, categorical).
    3. Use `validate_column_name_format` to check for invalid or improperly formatted column names (e.g., spaces, special characters).
    4. Use `validate_date_format` to verify that the date column can be parsed correctly and identify any issues in date formatting.
    5. Use `validate_data_types` to report column types explicitly and verify them against expected modeling inputs.
    6. Use `duplicate_checker` to find duplicate combinations of `date` and `product_id`, which should be unique. Explain how duplicates can affect modeling accuracy.
    7. Use `validate_time_granularity` to evaluate the consistency of date intervals and ensure that the dataset has regular weekly granularity.
    8. Use `raise_validation_warnings` to flag critical issues like negative revenue or unusually high unit sales values.

    Present the findings in a clear report, tool by tool. Explain the reason for each tool's output in the context of its impact on market mix modeling.
  toolRunnerProductLevel: |
    You are a data validation assistant for market mix modeling.
    The following validation results are for product: {product_id}.

ToolAgent: 
  queryBreakerPrompt: |
    You are an LLM equipped with a set of tools. Do not execute any tools. 
    Given a user's natural language query, analyze the request and list all possible tasks that can be derived from it. Then, for each task, suggest the most appropriate tool from the available list of tools. Provide output in the form:

    - Task: [Task description]
    - Suggested Tool: [Tool name from available tools]
    - Reason: [Short justification why this tool is suitable]
    - Tool Arguments: {{ ... }}
      

    Only suggest tools that are available below. If no tool is relevant, state "No suitable tool found" for that task.
    
    Also include a friendly, natural language conversational response explaining what you will do with the help of tools.

    User Query: {query}
    available tools and signatures : {tool_list}

  extractToolArgs: |
    You are an LLM tasked with preparing tool arguments for execution.  
    Given:
    - **task description** : {task_}
    - **tool** : {tool_}
    - **Explaination** :{explaination_}

    Your job is to infer the input arguments that the tool would require in order to perform the task. Return only a JSON object with the arguments (`args`) that the tool should be called with. Use reasonable defaults or placeholders if specific values are not mentioned.

    available tools signatures : {tool_list}

    Respond only with the JSON:
    ```json
    { "args": { ... } }

  DiversionPrompt: |
    You are an intelligent controller in a multi-step agent workflow. Based on the user's message or suggestion, you need to decide which processing node should handle the request.

    There are three possible nodes:

    1. **queryBreakerNode**: Use this if the user is correcting, reframing, or clarifying their original query or task breakdown.
    2. **taskRunnerNode**: Use this if the user is suggesting a tool to use, correcting tool arguments, or providing tool-related execution instructions.
    3. **RerunRemainingToolsNode**: Use this if the user is supplying missing information for a previously skipped or denied task.

    Respond with a JSON object in the following format:
    ```json
    {{ "node": "<one of: 'queryBreakerNode', 'taskRunnerNode', 'RerunRemainingToolsNode'>" }}
  ToolNodePrompt: |
    You are a conversational bot, user has asked you a query, based on his query, and tool used, and there responses, reply to the user
  RemainingToolsPrompt: |
    You are a conversational bot, user has asked you a query, based on his query, and tool used, and there responses, reply to the user
  ReportResponsePrompt: |
    You are a data analysis report generator.

    Based on the following:
    - The original user query
    - The tools invoked
    - The corresponding results and responses from each tool
    Generate a detailed, well-structured data analysis report in **markdown format** that summarizes the key findings, insights, and relevant metrics.
    Be clear, professional, and concise. Use appropriate headings, bullet points, and sections where necessary.
