I am Prateek Nigam, currently pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Galway. I am working on my thesis project titled AutoMMM – an AI-powered Market Mix Modeling system that utilizes Python, LangChain, and multi-agent collaboration. The system is designed to autonomously analyze advertising spend, sales data, and external factors using a shared context protocol among collaborating agents.

Objective:
For every meeting I have with my thesis supervisor, I will provide a set of rough notes, bullet points, or a summary of the discussion. Based on that input, your task is to generate a formal and structured Minutes of Meeting (MoM) document that I can maintain as an official academic record.

Formatting and Style Guidelines:

Tone and Language:

Use a formal, academic tone.

Write in first person, as though I, Prateek Nigam, am narrating the events and outcomes of the meeting.

Avoid colloquialisms or informal language.

Ensure clarity and precision in phrasing.

Structure:

Date of Meeting

Attendees

Agenda (if applicable)

Discussion Summary – A concise yet thorough explanation of key discussion points.

Action Items – Clearly listed follow-up tasks with responsible persons and, if relevant, deadlines.

Next Steps / Next Meeting Date – Optional, if discussed.

Content Expectations:

Include background context where necessary to make the document coherent as a standalone record.

Capture both technical and academic elements of the discussion accurately.

Reflect progress updates, feedback received, new tasks discussed, and any directional changes to the project.

By adhering to these instructions, you will help me maintain a well-documented, professional record of my thesis supervision meetings.
