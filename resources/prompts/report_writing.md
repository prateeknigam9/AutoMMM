# Prompt for Generating Thesis Proposal Report for AutoMMM Project

You are tasked with drafting a comprehensive thesis proposal report for a Master’s in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. The project is titled "AutoMMM: An AI-Powered Market Mix Modeling System Utilizing Multi-Agent Collaboration." The report should be written in a formal, academic tone, adhering to standard thesis proposal structure, including sections such as Introduction, Literature Review, Methodology, Expected Contributions, and Timeline. Below is the detailed context of the project to guide the report generation.

## Project Overview: AutoMMM
AutoMMM is an AI-powered Market Mix Modeling (MMM) system designed to autonomously analyze advertising spend, sales data, and external factors using a multi-agent collaboration framework. The system leverages Python, LangChain, and multi-agent orchestration to provide data-driven insights and actionable business recommendations. The system comprises two primary teams—Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Team and Modelling Team—along with a Contribution Running Agent and a final stage for generating business insights, all managed by a Supervisor Agent.

## System Components and Workflow
1. **Supervisor Agent**: Orchestrates the entire process, managing back-and-forth interactions between teams and agents to ensure seamless collaboration and alignment with project objectives.

2. **EDA Team**:
   - **Data Processing Agent**: 
     - Executes a Python script to perform exploratory data analysis on advertising spend, sales, and external factor datasets.
     - Generates an Excel file containing charts and an EDA report. The report includes formatted statistics, numbers, and insights on missing values, outlier treatment, events, external factors, and relevant research tools.
     - Populates a separate Excel sheet with the formatted EDA report for clarity and accessibility.
   - **Insight Generation Agent**: 
     - Creates an in-memory context capturing key performance indicators (KPIs), data explanations, and a data story based on the EDA report.
     - Ensures the context is structured to be utilized by the Model Tuning Agent for informed hyperparameter adjustments.

3. **Modelling Team**:
   - **Model Running Agent**: 
     - Executes a Python script to run the MMM model on the processed data.
     - Generates a folder in a specified directory containing model summary, performance metrics, and actual vs. predicted graphs saved as PNG files.
     - Operates autonomously, eliminating the need for manual intervention in running the model.
   - **Model Tuning Agent**: 
     - Utilizes the context from the Insight Generation Agent to understand data characteristics.
     - Iteratively adjusts model hyperparameters to improve accuracy, running multiple iterations until satisfactory performance is achieved.

4. **Contribution Running Agent**:
   - Executes a Python script to calculate contributions using the Shapley method, generating an Excel file with results.
   - Analyzes the contribution results post-generation to ensure alignment with the data story provided by the Insight Generation Agent.
   - If misalignments are detected, the agent iteratively adjusts parameters and recalculates contributions until results are consistent with the data story.

5. **Final MMM Suggestions and Insights**:
   - Translates contribution numbers into actionable business insights, focusing on return on investment (ROI), effectiveness, and contributions of each KPI.
   - Provides clear, data-driven recommendations for optimizing advertising spend and improving business outcomes.

## Report Requirements
- **Introduction**: Provide background on Market Mix Modeling, the role of AI in marketing analytics, and the motivation for developing AutoMMM. Clearly state the research problem and objectives.
- **Literature Review**: Review existing MMM approaches, multi-agent systems, and AI applications in marketing analytics. Highlight gaps that AutoMMM addresses, such as automation and multi-agent collaboration.
- **Methodology**: 
  - Describe the technical architecture of AutoMMM, including the roles of each agent and their interactions under the Supervisor Agent.
  - Explain the use of Python and LangChain for implementation.
  - Detail the data processing, modeling, contribution analysis, and insight generation processes, including specific algorithms (e.g., Shapley method) and tools.
- **Expected Contributions**: Outline the academic and practical contributions, such as advancing autonomous MMM systems, improving model accuracy through context-driven tuning, and providing actionable business insights.
- **Timeline**: Provide a realistic timeline for project milestones, including data collection, agent development, model training, testing, and report writing.
- **References**: Include relevant academic papers, books, and resources on MMM, multi-agent systems, and AI in marketing.

## Formatting and Style Guidelines
- Write in a formal, academic tone, avoiding colloquial language.
- Use clear, precise language to describe technical processes and agent functionalities.
- Ensure the report is structured as a standalone document, providing sufficient context for readers unfamiliar with the project.
- Include diagrams or flowcharts to illustrate the system architecture and agent interactions, if applicable.
- Target a length of approximately 15–20 pages, excluding references and appendices.

Generate a thesis proposal report that adheres to these guidelines, incorporating the detailed project context provided above. Ensure the report is cohesive, well-organized, and suitable for submission as part of a Master’s thesis in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence.
